# Replication Exercise #1: 
### Sam Cohen and Priscila Stisman

This repository contains the materials for our attempted replication of outcomes and code from Arthur Spirling's 2016 paper, "Democratization and Linguistic Complexity:
The Effect of Franchise Extension on Parliamentary Discourse, 1832â€“1915."

## Code 
The code can be found in the **spirling_rep.rmd** file. 

## Data
The code uses the **bigrame.Rdata** file (quantitative data on speeches) found in the same directory, as well as the raw speech data (the code access speech CSVs in a folder titled "**speeches_by_parliament**"), which should be placed in the same directory in the folder with the same name. The raw speeches data was too large to push to this repository, and can be found at this link: https://andy.egge.rs/eggers_spirling_database.html

## Other resources
- The "Original Paper" folder contains the full article by Spirling, as well as the author's replication code and materials. The Harvard Dataverse page for this paper can be found here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/EZBYBZ
