## Introduction

This report will detail our efforts to replicate specific code and outcomes from Arthur Spirling’s 2016 paper “Democratization and Linguistic Complexity.” Spirling’s paper explores how the readability of parliamentary speeches increases overtime, especially as a result of the Second Reform Act of 1867, which took away property requirements for voting and enfranchised a significant portion of Britain’s population (Spirling 2016). He hypothesizes that cabinet members’ speech interpretability will become increasingly understandable overtime due to their prominent roles in government and newfound need to appeal to a new electorate— one that was less wealthy, less literate, and less educated as a whole (Ibid). Contrarily, backbenchers would not need to change their speech, as they are generally considered the “rank and file” and are not given the same level of public attention (Ibid). Spirling uses temporal trends of readability metrics (FRE scores, for instance) and multivariate regressions to assist in his findings, which were relatively similar to his hypothesis. Our project attempts to replicate significant portions of this study, specifically temporal trends of readability, and the primary multivariate regression Spirling runs. We also add original research to this domain using the same data: readability of speeches by party, and TF-IDF and cosine similarity score analysis.

## Differences & Similarities

### FRE scores

The FRE Statistics results are very similar, though not identical. Our values for the minimum, first quartile, median, mean, and third quartile closely match those in the paper, with only a slight difference in the third quartile. However, the maximum differs significantly: while the paper reports a maximum FRE of 205.80, our result is 121.22. The bulk of the distribution is between 0 and 100, as in the paper.

The average readability score, in both the paper and our replication exercise, indicates that around the year 1860, the average cabinet speech becomes more comprehensible than the average non-cabinet speech, whereas before that, their mean comprehension scores were quite similar.

### FRE Trends

Spirling plots the mean FRE scores over time by cabinet position (Ibid, 128). The general trend is stable and relatively unchanging before 1867, after which the scores increase dramatically for cabinet members, and only slightly for backbenchers (Ibid). Likewise, in our replication, we get a similar result. One slight difference is that the point of convergence between cabinet members and backbenchers in terms of readability happens much earlier than it does in Spirling’s plot. However, this might be due to us aggregating based on year and not by quarter. 

We also recreate the average syllable count per word score over time plot (Ibid, 129). We find almost the exact same trends (a decrease for cabinet MPs, stability for backbenchers), albeit at a smoother rate due to us aggregating by year and not quarter. 

Overall, the general trends seem to match, with cabinet FRE scores overtaking those of backbenchers several years before 1867.

### OLS Regression

The OLS regression results for comprehension scores by cabinet position, using the same set of controls as the authors, yield very similar coefficients, though not identical. However, the sign of the coefficients is consistent in all cases. Some of our coefficients have lower p-values than those in the paper. For example, the Reform Act dummy is significant at the 1% level in our results, while in the paper, it is significant at the 5% level.

## Autopsy

### Data Retrieval

We use two primary data sets, which are essentially different iterations of each other. The first data set is the “bigframe” data set used for quantitative analysis in Spirling’s research. This data set contains metadata on the year a speech took place, the word and syllable count, FRE score, political party of the MP in question, whether or not they were a cabinet member, and the competitiveness of their seat. We also use the raw speech data in both our attempt to recreate much Spirling’s analysis, as well as in our original additions. Like Spirling, we subset for speeches only between the years 1832 and 1915. We also derive a random sample of 10,000 from the raw speeches due to the sheer size of the data. 

Retrieving this data was not very intuitive. While Spirling has a Harvard Dataverse page for his replication materials, it only included the code and bigframe numerical data—that is, there was no raw data in this repository. To find the raw speech data, we navigated to the Arthur Spirling and Andy Eggers Database, which included the CSVs for the raw data.

### Replication Challenges

One of the primary challenges we faced was the fact that we used only a sample of the raw speech data. While we believed 10,000 observations out of well over 600,000 would be representative, there were still some discrepancies in our results. For instance, while the mean and median FRE scores for our sampled speeches were relatively similar to those in the paper, the standard deviation was a lot larger, and the minimum and maximum values we quite different as well.

Another challenge we encountered was interpreting very large and very small FRE scores. While FRE scores typically range between 0 and 100, both the paper and our replication indicated scores much higher and lower than these thresholds. After some research, we discovered that it is indeed possible to have FRE scores below 0 (if language is particularly complex).

### Replication Successes

Perhaps our greatest replication success was our results for Spirling's multivariate regression. Coefficients differed only slightly, if at all. This success was likely due to us using the bigframe data rather than our samples and cleaned raw data. While a LaTex illustration of the regression was not provided in the paper, we were still able to recreate it with good results.
