# Replication Exercise #1: 
### Sam Cohen and Priscila Stisman

This repository contains the materials for our attempted replication of outcomes and code from Arthur Spirling's 2016 paper, "Democratization and Linguistic Complexity:
The Effect of Franchise Extension on Parliamentary Discourse, 1832â€“1915."

## Code 
The code can be found in the **spirling_rep.rmd** file. 

## Data
The code uses the **bigrame.Rdata** file (quantitative data on speeches) found in the same directory, as well as the raw speech data (the code access speech CSVs in a folder titled "**speeches_by_parliament**," which should be placed in the same directory. The raw speeches data too large to push to this repository, and can be found at this link: https://andy.egge.rs/eggers_spirling_database.html
